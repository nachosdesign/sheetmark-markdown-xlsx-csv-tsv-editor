Second horizontal rule immediately after the first:

Code blocks:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) throw new Error('Division by zero');
  return a / b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

// Extra lines so the fence block spans multiple source lines
console.log(add(2, 3));
console.log(subtract(5, 2));
console.log(multiply(4, 5));
```

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def farewell(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Goodbye, {name}!"

for person in ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "Dan", "Eve"]:
    print(greet(person))
    print(farewell(person))
```

## Tables

Simple two-column table:

| Header 1 | Header 2                               | Header 3 |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2 with cleaned-up text for readability | Cell 3   |
| Row 2 A  | Row 2 B with enough text to force wrapping when the preview pane is narrow | Row 2 C |
| Row 4 A  | Row 4 B — brand new row                    | Row 4 C  |
| Row 5 A  | Row 5 B — round five row                   | Row 5 C  |

```

## Definition list

Term one
: Definition for term one spanning a couple of clauses so it is not a single short line.

Term two
: Second definition with **emphasis** and a [link](https://example.com).

Term three
: Third term added in round three — tests definition list diffs.

Term four
: Fourth definition — round five addition with ~~removed text~~ and `code`.

Term five
: Fifth term — round six. Includes ***bold italic*** markup.

## Images

Missing image (should show an error placeholder):

![Alt text for a missing image](missing-sample-image.png)

## Footnotes

Footnote reference[^1], a second reference[^2], a third reference[^3], and a fourth[^4].

[^1]: Footnote text goes here. Add extra sentences so the footnote block occupies more vertical space in the preview footer area.
[^2]: Second footnote with `inline code` and **bold** for renderer coverage.
[^3]: Third footnote — round three addition for diff testing.
[^4]: Fourth footnote — round five. References the [project repo](https://github.com).

## Line breaks

Line break test:
This paragraph uses an explicit Markdown line break.\\
and another one here\\
to build a taller block without extra blank lines.

## Extra section for scroll spy


Content under subsection A. Scroll the preview and watch the TOC highlight track this heading. Round five.

### Subsection Bdfds

Content under subsection B. Enough filler to make scrolling meaningful when testing sync between editor and preview panes. Round four tweak.


#### adsfnsadk

### Subsection E


### Subsection C

Final subsection. End of `samples/test.md` test document — round six still editing.

## Diff test section (added 2026-08-20)

This section was added to exercise diff rendering in the markdown editor. **Round six** — still going.

| Change type | Example |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Modified    | Frontmatter `version` bumped to 2.7 |
| Added       | Iris row, subtract(), Term five, Subsection E, note callout |
| Removed     | Lorem ipsum from second paragraph |
| Fixed       | Two tasks checked off, info callout shortened |
| Round 6     | Eighth ordered item, mermaid reload node, alias diff-playground |
