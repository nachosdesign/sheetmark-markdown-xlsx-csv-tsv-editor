# Heading 1 — round six

This intro paragraph replaces the placeholder gibberish above. It now includes a **second sentence** for diff visibility, a *third* for round three, round four keeps editing, round five continues, and round six edits again.

## Heading 2 — round six rename dsjs
 Ddnwkdnw
### Heading 3 — mid-tree edit

#### Heading 4 — deepest level edited


**Hello**

- First bullet with real text
- Second bullet for list preview
- Third bullet to exercise wrapping in narrow panes
- Fourth bullet added in round three
- Fifth bullet — round five

## Hello (capitalized) — v2

- Nested spacing test dsjfbsj
- Another item with consistent indentation dhsd
- Round four list mak
- Round six list item

`inline-code-sample-v3`

Plain paragraph with **bold**, *italic*, ***bold italic***, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.

A second paragraph to pad scroll height. Round six replaced the lorem opener with this shorter line.

A [link](https://example.com), a [second link](https://github.com), a [third link](https://cursor.com), and a bare URL [https://example.com](https://example.com).

> Blockquote line one — edited.
> Blockquote line two — also edited.

> Blockquote line two — also edited.
> Blockquote line two — also edited.
> Blockquote line two — also edited.
> Blockquote line two — also edited.

>
> Blockquote with a third paragraph for height — still here from round two.

Unordered list:

- Item one with corrected pellingspelling
- Item two (renamed from "hey")
- Item three (renamed from "threedfsds")
- Item four
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item with longer text that may wrap in narrow panes
- Item five (was duplicate "Item three")
- Item six — round six addition

Ordered list:

1. First
2. Second (typo fixed)
    3. Nested step
3. Third
4. Fourth item added for length
5. Fifth item — new for diff testing
6. Sixth item — round three addition
7. Seventh item — round five
8. Eighth item — round six

Task list:

- [x] Done task
- [x] Previously open — now checked off
- [x] Second open task — checked off in round four
- [x] Round five task — freshly added
- [x] New unchecked task — checked in round six
- [ ] Round six task — open

## Hanging indent test

Flat bullet list, one item long enough to soft-wrap in a normal-width pane — the wrapped line should hang-indent under the item's own text, not reset to the flat editor margin:

- Short item
- This bullet item has a deliberately long sentence so that in a normal-width editor pane it soft-wraps onto a second visual line, which should hang-indent under "This", not reset to the flat editor margin.
- Third item

Three-level nested bullets (dot filled at depth 1, outline at depth 2 and 3; each level's marker should cascade to sit under its parent's text):

- Depth 1 item
  - Depth 2 item, also with enough extra text that it wraps onto a second line to confirm the wrapped line still hangs under "Depth", not under the depth-1 marker
    - Depth 3 item

Three-level nested ordered list (decimal at depth 1, lowercase alpha at depth 2, lowercase roman at depth 3):

1. Depth 1, decimal
   1. Depth 2, alpha
      1. Depth 3, roman i
      2. Depth 3, roman ii
      3. Depth 3, roman iii
      4. Depth 3, roman iv

Crossing 9 → 10 items (column should already fit "10." — no jump):

1. Item one
2. Item two
3. Item three
4. Item four
5. Item five
6. Item six
7. Item seven
8. Item eight
9. Item nine
10. Item ten
11. Item eleven

Crossing into triple digits (column should visibly widen once "100." appears, evenly across the whole list):

97. Ninety-seven
98. Ninety-eight
99. Ninety-nine
100. One hundred
101. One hundred one

Mixed task + plain bullet in one list (checkbox and dot should share the same text-start column):

- [ ] Unchecked task
- Plain bullet item
- [x] Checked task

Lazy continuation — the second line below is a raw continuation of the same bullet's paragraph, with no blank line separating them, so it should hang-indent under "continues":

- This item's text continues
  on a second source line with no blank line separating them.

Blockquote containing a list (known v1 cosmetic gap — the list's own column wins over the blockquote's left-border accent):

> Quoted intro
> - Quoted bullet one
> - Quoted bullet two

::: info
Info callout — tests the markdown-it container plugin. Round six refresh.
:::

::: warning
Warning callout with **bold** and `code` inside. Round five appended this note.
:::

::: tip
New tip callout added in the second round of edits. Round three adds this trailing sentence.
:::

::: danger
Danger callout — round three addition for diff coverage. Escalated in round six.
:::

::: note
Note callout — brand new in round six.
:::

Horizontal rule (mid-document — must NOT be treated as YAML frontmatter):

---

Second horizontal rule immediately after the first:

---

Code blocks:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) throw new Error('Division by zero');
  return a / b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

// Extra lines so the fence block spans multiple source lines
console.log(add(2, 3));
console.log(subtract(5, 2));
console.log(multiply(4, 5));
console.log(divide(10, 2));
```

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def farewell(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Goodbye, {name}!"

for person in ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "Dan", "Eve"]:
    print(greet(person))
    print(farewell(person))
```

## Tables

Simple two-column table:

| Row 3 A  | Row 3 B — updated in round three         | Row 3 C  |
| Row 4 A  | Row 4 B — brand new row                    | Row 4 C  |
| Row 5 A  | Row 5 B — round five row                   | Row 5 C  |

## Mermaid

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Markdown file] --> B[extractFrontmatter]
    B --> C{Valid YAML?}
    C -->|yes| D[YAML card]
    C -->|no| E[hr + paragraphs]
    B --> F[Body → markdown-it]
    F --> G[Diff overlay]
    G --> H[Save to disk]
    H --> I[Version snapshot]
    I --> J[Reload webview]
```

## Definition list

Term one
: Definition for term one spanning a couple of clauses so it is not a single short line.

Term two
: Second definition with **emphasis** and a [link](https://example.com).

Term three
: Third term added in round three — tests definition list diffs.

Term four
: Fourth definition — round five addition with ~~removed text~~ and `code`.

Term five
: Fifth term — round six. Includes ***bold italic*** markup.

## Images

![Super Viewer icon](icon.png)

Missing image (should show an error placeholder):

![Alt text for a missing image](missing-sample-image.png)

## Footnotes

Footnote reference[^1], a second reference[^2], a third reference[^3], and a fourth[^4].

[^1]: Footnote text goes here. Add extra sentences so the footnote block occupies more vertical space in the preview footer area.
[^2]: Second footnote with `inline code` and **bold** for renderer coverage.
[^3]: Third footnote — round three addition for diff testing.
[^4]: Fourth footnote — round five. References the [project repo](https://github.com).

## Line breaks

Line break test:
This line ends with two trailing spaces.  
This is on a new line — round six edit.

This paragraph uses an explicit Markdown line break.\\
and another one here\\
to build a taller block without extra blank lines.

## Extra section for scroll spy

### Subsection A

Content under subsection A. Scroll the preview and watch the TOC highlight track this heading. Round five refresh.

### Subsection B

Content under subsection B. Enough filler to make scrolling meaningful when testing sync between editor and preview panes. Round four tweak.

### Subsection D

New subsection added in round four for TOC diff testing. Extended in round six.

### Subsection E

Subsection E — inserted in round six between D and C.

### Subsection C

Final subsection. End of `samples/test.md` test document — round six still editing.

## Diff test section (added 2026-08-20)

This section was added to exercise diff rendering in the markdown editor. **Round six** — still going.

| Change type | Example |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Modified    | Frontmatter `version` bumped to 2.7 |
| Added       | Iris row, subtract(), Term five, Subsection E, note callout |
| Removed     | Lorem ipsum from second paragraph |
| Fixed       | Two tasks checked off, info callout shortened |
| Round 6     | Eighth ordered item, mermaid reload node, alias diff-playground |
